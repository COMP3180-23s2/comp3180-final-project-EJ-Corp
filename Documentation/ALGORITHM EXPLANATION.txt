ALGORITHM EXPLANATION
Step 1 - Generate a Grid: 
	- Algorithm takes a grid width & height within the inspector
	- Before generating the grid the middle position of the grid is found by diving both the 	  width and height in half - producing the middle coordinate.
	- Once middle found the algorithm generates a cell at 0,0 and names the cell with it's 	  	  position within the grid.
	- After this the process is repeated in a loop generating all of the cells within a 	   	  coloumn (based from the height input) and then moving unot the next column up until the 	  algortihm reaches the width input provided.
	- NOTE: if the coordinate matches the middle position the cell gets stored as a variable    	  to be used during the next step.
