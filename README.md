# COMP3180-final-project

Included is a rough timeline below. Fill this in from week to week to show your progress throughout semester.

## Week 1 - Selecting a Project

Complete the "Choose a Topic" survey in iLearn and paste the details here.

**Topic Details - Procedural Generation (ProcGen):**

*Initial Description* - I want to create a procedurally generated dungeon which feels recative to certain player conditions, making the player feel like the dungeon is crafted to their specific scenario rather than random every time.

*Initial Research Interests*:
* Basic procedural generation algorithms used in games.
* Item and enemy procedural generation.
* Distributed biome generation.
* Dungeon generation tools.

*Potential Project 1:*

A dungeon generation algorithm which randomly generates a dungeon (Different everytime) based on a rigid set of rules. However, the dungeon should/could generate differently based on changing variables relatated to the player's situation (Reactive). This way the generated dungeon feels like it has been crafted to challenge/reward the player rather than feeling random all of the time.

*Potential Project 2:*

A dungeon building tool which contains a database of room layouts and creates a random dungeon using those rooms. Additionally it lets the user create rooms and add them to the database by providing different parameters such as chance weights and rules.

*Initial Findings:*

Begin by creating an algortihm that generates a floor plan without thinking about special rooms, objects or rules (Creates a tree/graph). Then utilize the product to add the special rooms and rules that fit your purpose (Rewards & Advancement rooms).

## Week 2 - Familiarising yourself with the tools

You need to have accepted this assignment repo and made a post here identifying a resource relevant to your topic.
